## 📌 Project Overview

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are critical components of modern network security architectures. They are used to monitor network traffic, detect malicious activities, and respond appropriately.

This project focuses on configuring **Snort 2** as an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to detect malicious activities such as ICMP reconnaissance, Nmap TCP SYN scans, hping3-based SYN flood attacks, and unauthorized SSH connection attempts. The project also includes a critical analysis of IDS and IPS technologies and their effectiveness against modern cyber threats.

## 🎯 Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:

- Configure Snort 2 as an Intrusion Detection System
- Write and deploy custom Snort rules
- Detect ICMP, Nmap, and hping3 traffic
- Monitor unauthorized SSH connection attempts
- Critically analyse IDS and IPS tools and their effectiveness

---

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

- **IDS Tool:** Snort 2
- **Target Machine:** Metasploitable
- **Rule File:** `local.rules`
- **Mode:** IDS (Passive Monitoring)

Snort was deployed in IDS mode to monitor network traffic directed at the target machine. Custom rules were written and placed in the `local.rules` file, which is included in the main Snort configuration file.

## 🔍 Custom Snort Rules and Traffic Detection

### 1️⃣ ICMP Traffic Detection

```snort
alert icmp any any -> 192.168.56.102 any (msg:"ALERT: Suspicious Ping to Metasploitable"; sid:1000005; rev:1;)
```

**Explanation:**
This rule detects ICMP echo requests (ping) directed at the Metasploitable machine. ICMP traffic is often used during reconnaissance to identify live hosts.

---

### 2️⃣ Nmap TCP SYN Scan Detection

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any any (flags:S; msg:"NMAP TCP SYN Scan Detected"; sid:1000006; rev:1;)
```

**Explanation:**
This rule triggers an alert when TCP packets with the SYN flag set are detected. TCP SYN packets are commonly used by Nmap during stealth scans.

---

### 3️⃣ hping3 SYN Flood Detection

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (flags:S; msg:"DoS Attack: TCP SYN Flood Detected"; detection_filter:track by_src, count 30, seconds 10; sid:1000007; rev:1;)
```

**Explanation:**
This rule detects potential SYN flood attacks generated by tools such as hping3. The detection filter helps reduce false positives by only triggering alerts when a defined threshold is exceeded.

---

### 4️⃣ SSH Connection Attempt Detection

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any 22 (msg:"SSH Connection Attempt Detected"; flags:S; sid:1000008; rev:1;)
```

**Explanation:**
This rule monitors TCP connection attempts to the SSH service (port 22). It is useful for detecting brute-force attacks or unauthorized access attempts.

## 🧠 Critical Analysis of IDS and IPS Effectiveness

### Passive vs Active Defense

| Feature        | IDS                | IPS                |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Deployment     | Out-of-band        | Inline             |
| Response       | Alert only         | Blocks traffic     |
| Latency        | None               | Possible           |
| Failure Impact | Loss of visibility | Network disruption |

- **IDS** monitors traffic passively without interfering with network flow.
- **IPS** actively blocks malicious traffic but may introduce latency or availability issues.

---

## 🔬 Detection Methodologies

### Signature-Based Detection

- Matches traffic against known attack signatures
- Highly effective against known threats
- Ineffective against zero-day attacks
- Requires frequent rule updates

### Anomaly-Based Detection

- Detects deviations from normal network behaviour
- Capable of detecting zero-day attacks
- Prone to high false positive rates
- Modern research focuses on ML-based improvements

---

## 🎯 Effectiveness Against Common Attack Types

- **DoS/DDoS Attacks:**
  IDS can detect flooding attacks, but large-scale mitigation is more effective at the ISP or cloud level.

- **Encrypted Traffic (HTTPS/TLS):**
  Limited visibility without SSL/TLS decryption, which introduces performance overhead.

- **Zero-Day Exploits:**
  Signature-based systems perform poorly, while anomaly-based systems offer moderate detection.

- **Lateral Movement:**
  IDS is highly effective at detecting internal scanning and east-west traffic.

---

## 🚀 Modern Research Trends (2023–2025)

- Hybrid IDS combining signature-based and anomaly-based detection
- Lightweight IDS solutions for IoT environments
- Adversarial Machine Learning and AI-driven evasion techniques
- AI-versus-AI security arms race

## 📊 Comparative Summary

| Feature          | Signature-Based IDS (Snort) | Anomaly-Based IDS      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Known Attacks    | Excellent                   | Good                   |
| Zero-Day Attacks | Poor                        | Moderate               |
| False Positives  | Low                         | High                   |
| Maintenance      | High (rule updates)         | High (baseline tuning) |
| Throughput       | High                        | Lower                  |

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates that **Snort 2** is an effective IDS for detecting reconnaissance activities and basic network attacks such as ICMP probes, Nmap SYN scans, hping3-based SYN floods, and unauthorized SSH connection attempts.

While IDS and IPS tools remain vital components of network defense, their limitations against encrypted traffic, zero-day exploits, and large-scale DDoS attacks highlight the importance of layered security approaches. Future intrusion detection systems will increasingly rely on hybrid and AI-driven techniques to adapt to evolving threats.
